Temporary Stop Defaults
=======================

By default, temporary train stops in Factorio always make the train wait 5
seconds, then continue. This mod adds per-player settings to customize the
conditions used on temporary stops, including waiting for a period of
inactivity, waiting for a player to board or leave the train, or waiting
indefinitely.

This mod has no in-game user interface. Check the Settings screen (under the
third tab, "Per-player") for configuration options.
